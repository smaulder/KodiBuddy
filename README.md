# KodiBuddy
KodiBuddy is a program for managing your video repositories folder and files. 

NOTE:  KodiBuddy is in a state of early development.  Before running it against your video repository create 
yourself a testing folder structure and COPY some of your repository into the test folder structure and run 
some tests against your test folder structure so you know what the outcome will be when you do run against your repository.

Options Tab - use this tab to set the paths to your library, the path to the folder you use to import your video files and set other default settings.

KodiBuddy Tab - functions include:

      Change Date Brackets - Use this to change what encloses the folder names year.  
            Options are parentheses or brackets.

      The Movie DB Update - Rename video files to match the folder name.

      Video Import - Imports video files into your video repository and creates folders if they are missing.

      FileReName - You can use it to add the movie year to folder names.

      ReMap Folders - Use this to rearrange the movies into genre folder structures.


Future Developments will include: 

     Merging the existing individual functions into one overarching process.
     
     Adding simular functionality in for TV shows and Music.
